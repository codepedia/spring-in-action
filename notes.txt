As you can see, JdbcIngredientRepository is annotated with @Repository. This
annotation is one of a handful of stereotype annotations that Spring defines, including
@Controller and @Component. By annotating JdbcIngredientRepository with
@Repository, you declare that it should be automatically discovered by Spring component
scanning and instantiated as a bean in the Spring application context.
When Spring creates the JdbcIngredientRepository bean, it injects it with Jdbc-
Template via the @Autowired annotated construction. The constructor assigns
JdbcTemplate to an instance variable that will be used in other methods to query and
insert into the database. Speaking of those other methods, letâ€™s take a look at the
implementations of findAll() and findById().
